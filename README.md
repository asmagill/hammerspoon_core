Pre-Release and In progress Core Hammerspoon Modules
====================================================

This repository contains modifications to core Hammerspoon modules which are being considered for future inclusion in the Hammerspoon application.

The current state of any module within this repository is not guaranteed, but because it is sometimes useful to share things with others before formally including them in the master branch at https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon or in a formal release, this staging area may contain pre-release versions of some of the core modules.

Use at your own risk.
