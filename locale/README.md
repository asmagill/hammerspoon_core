<a name="registerCallback"></a>
~~~lua
locale.registerCallback(function) -> uuidString
~~~
Registers a function to be invoked when anything in the user's locale settings change

Parameters:
 * `fn` - the function to be invoked when a setting changes

Returns:
 * a uuid string which can be used to unregister a callback function when you no longer require notification of changes

Notes:
 * The callback function will not receive any arguments and should return none.  You can retrieve the new locale settings with [hs.host.locale.localeInformation](#localeInformation) and check its keys to determine if the change is of interest.

 * Any change made within the Language and Region settings panel will trigger this callback, even changes which are not reflected in the locale information provided by [hs.host.locale.localeInformation](#localeInformation).

<a name="unregisterCallback"></a>
~~~lua
locale.unregisterCallback(uuidString) -> boolean
~~~
Unregister a callback function when you no longer care about changes to the user's locale

Parameters:
 * `uuidString` - the uuidString returned by [hs.host.locale.registerCallback](#registerCallback) when you registered the callback function

Returns:
 * true if the callback was successfully unregistered or false if it was not, usually because the uuidString does not correspond to a current callback function.
